# 1000BullsGenome_Taurus_Indicus_private_SNPs
A collection of code made for my Bachelor Thesis in Bioinformatics. We used data from the 1000 Bulls Genome Project Run-9 to look for SNPs that are private in Bos taurus and Bos indicus. The aim was to indentify such diagnostic SNPs and allow breaders an easier classification of an individual to B.taurus or B.indicus.
